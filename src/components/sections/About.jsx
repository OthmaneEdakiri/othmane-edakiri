            I am a passionate web developer who considers myself a specialist in
            full-stack development (React.js and Laravel).I am a passionate web
            developer focused on bringing the technical aspects of digital
            products to life. Writing clear, readable, and highly performant
            code matters to me, along with delivering a smooth and efficient

            I began my journey as a web developer in 2021, and since then, Iâ€™ve
            continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
            challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now,
            in my mid-twenties, 3 years after starting my web development
            journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern
            technologies such as React.js, Laravel, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and
            many more.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-normal">
            I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
            end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
